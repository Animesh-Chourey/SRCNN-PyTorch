# Image Super-resolution Using Deep Learning

Image super-resolution with	deep convolutional neural network is performed and its performance is evaluated through peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR). PSNR evaluates image restoration quality and is at least partially related to the perceptual quality.

Critical analysis of the trends in Image Super-Resolution is also done. The original paper can be found here: [SRCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00092.pdf)
